# JavaScript at home exercise

We will build on the exercise we completed in class. While it might be easier to build a web page via HTML, for this exercise we will create the element of a website using JavaScipt.

Add a script tag to the index.html file and use JavaScript to create 5 paragraphs with the text:

* This is paragraph 1
* This is paragraph 2
* This is paragraph 3
* This is paragraph 4
* This is paragraph 5
