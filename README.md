# JavaScript at home exercise

We will build on the exercise we completed in class. For this weeks exercise we are going to use what we have covered so far in JavaScript to make a very annoying webpage.

* Add a script tag to the index.html file.
* Using JavaScript create a webpage that opens 5 alert boxes one after the other. (You won't see the second until you dismiss the first)
* The alert boxes should say something like "This is alert 1", "This is alert 2", "This is alert 3" etc.

You should combine the things we learned from class, including loops and variables.
